# Name: Getting Ready for Energy-Efficient Networking (GREEN)
## Description 

As the desire to improve energy efficiency gains momentum, network operators increasingly focus on understanding energy consumption by different links, nodes, and devices within their networks. Energy-aware networking encompasses deploying and managing network infrastructures to reduce energy consumption, optimize energy efficiency, and minimize environmental impact. This will involve technologies to monitor energy consumption, evaluate the effectiveness of energy saving polices, use control strategies to improve energy efficiency, and foster sustainability in network operations.

This BoF is intended to discuss these objectives and determine whether there is a community of interest to work on these topics within the IETF through a new working group (provisionally called GREEN).

This working group would develop a suite of short-term deliverables aimed at enhancing energy efficiency within networks. Key objectives include standardizing terms and definitions for energy metrics, reporting energy consumption usage at different levels in the network via YANG models, and providing YANG RPCs for better energy management. Additionally, the group could create a framework to describe the effective collection and utilization of these metrics and attributes. The proposed approach is to tackle energy efficiency challenges in a systematic and incremental manner, focusing on practical building blocks that contribute to overarching energy efficiency goals.

## Information for IAB/IESG
To allow evaluation of your proposal, please include the following items:

- Any protocols or practices that already exist in this space:
  - See the work of the closed EMAN working group.
- Which (if any) modifications to existing protocols or practices are required:
  - Approaches are likely to use Netconf/Restconf and YANG.
- Which (if any) entirely new protocols or practices are required:
  - None identified so far.
- Open source projects (if any) implementing this work:
  - None identified so far.


## Agenda
The proposed agenda as follows:
-	The usual administrivia
-	A chance for the AD to say what he expects from the meeting
-	An introduction to the topic from someone who knows how nodes and components use power
-	An overview of the desires and objectives preferably from a network operator
-	A summary of the sorts of things a working group do
-	A discussion
-	The draft charter
-	Questions for the room
